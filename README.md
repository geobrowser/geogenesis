# Geo Genesis

The current systems we use for managing and sharing information are broken. They’re controlled by corporations, making it hard for individuals and communities to retain control over their work. The internet was supposed to decentralize power but that power’s been reconcentrated into platforms. We need better tools for processing, curating, and making sense of information using public means that we can depend on and trust. We need that work to be verifiable and composable so that knowledge can be shared and used across applications.

It’s time to bring real world data onto The Graph and change how people cooperate and organize.

## Our goals with Geo are to:

1. Make it easy for communities to organize public knowledge and information into a knowledge graph
2. Create the best possible user interface for browsing and adding data to the global knowledge graph
3. Give communities the ability to create reputation systems based on merit, giving people power to influence their areas of expertise
4. Create political, cultural, and technological change by helping communities solve big challenges

Everything is information. The tools we use to organize information influence the structure of our companies, our institutions, and society itself. Geo is a new tool for organizing any kind of information.

Geo Genesis is a dapp for adding data to and searching for data from the global knowledge graph. Each datapoint is a triple with an entity, attribute, and value.

Information on Geo is interconnected and verifiable. You can see who added what and what process was used to vote on and accept that information. By introducing flexible reputation and governance systems, each community, or Space, can decide for themselves how they want to come to consensus on their part of the knowledge graph. Each industry can manage its own data, process for allocating power, and user interfaces. Geo Genesis has a stripped down feature set, but the initial users can help us make sure we have the starting point right.

## How can we use crypto to help solve the world’s biggest challenges?

Most of the big problems in the world are problems of coordination. We either can’t agree on what the right course of action is or we have the wrong incentives in place. Humans are endlessly creative. With the right incentives and coordination tools, there’s no problem we can’t solve. At Geo, we want to take that outlook and focus it on one geography to start so we can go deep and put these ideas into action. The city we’re going to focus on initially is San Francisco. We’re going to be using in person events to organize and help make a difference using web3. If we’re successful in using web3 for impact at a local level, people can adopt what works in other cities to scale around the globe.

Crypto is a technological, political, and cultural movement. The technology for web3 is almost ready. The other two acts are about to get started.

## What's next?

During this beta continue to make the Geo Genesis dApp better with your feedback. We're moving towards opening write permissions to users in small batches. Additionally we'll be adding documentation for contributing to the Geo Genesis dApp and documentation for consuming our contracts and subgraphs to write your own dApps.

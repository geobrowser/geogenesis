# Types

A Type in the Geo knowledge graph is an [Entity](01-entities.md) that describes what another Entity _is_. An Entity can have one or many types, and the types describe the "shape" of the Entity's data.

For example, Bill Gates might have the `Person` type as well as the `Founder` type. Each of these types might define an expected shape for the data in Bill Gates.

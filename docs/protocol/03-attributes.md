# Attributes

An Attribute in Geo is an [Entity](01-entities.md) that's used to describe what the [Value](04-values.md) of a [Triple](02-triples.md) is meant to represent. An Attribute is an Entity, so has all the same properties that any other Entity has.

For example, a Triple might define the name of an entity. This Triple would reference the entity's ID, the Name Attribute by it's ID, and the Value of the name, e.g., Bill Gates.

> [Entity ID, Name's Entity ID, "Bill Gates"]

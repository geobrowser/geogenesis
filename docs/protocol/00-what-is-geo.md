# What is Geo?

Geo is two things: 1) the protocol, and 2) Geo Genesis, a dApp.

At it's core, the Geo protocol is a worldwide, public, decentralized graph database built with Polygon, IPFS, and a data service deployed on The Graph Horizon.

Geo enables us to curate the world's public knowledge in a trustless, decentralized, transparent way.

The Geo Genesis dApp is meant to be the best interface for interacting with the public knowledge in the Geo protocol.

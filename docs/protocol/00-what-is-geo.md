# What is Geo?

Geo is two things: 1) the protocol, and 2) Geo Genesis, a dApp.

At it's core, the Geo protocol is essentially a worldwide, public, decentralized graph database built with Polygon, IPFS, and a data service deployed on The Graph Horizon.

The Geo Genesis dApp is meant to be the best interface for interacting with the Geo protocol and knowledge graph.

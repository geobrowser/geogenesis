# What is Geo?

Geo is two things: 1) the protocol, and 2) Geo Genesis, a dApp.

At it's core, the Geo protocol is a worldwide, public, decentralized graph database built with Polygon, IPFS, and a data service deployed on The Graph Horizon. Geo enables us to curate the world's public knowledge in a trustless, decentralized, transparent way.

The Geo Genesis dApp is meant to be the best interface for interacting with the public knowledge in the Geo protocol.

### Data model

Knowledge in Geo is organized into an ["Entity"](./01-entities.md), a uniquely identifiable data structure that is referenced by ["Triples"](02-triples.md).

A [Triple](02-triples.md) is a data structure composed of three elements: an [Entity](01-entities.md) identifier, an [Attribute](03-attributes.md) identifier, and a [Value](04-values.md) identifier. Composing these identifier references between entities and triples creates the graph of information in Geo.

Triples are scoped to [Spaces](06-spaces.md). A Space is a smart contract that tracks data added to the knowledge graph via an append-only log of [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) [content identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing) (CIDs). The Geo knowledge graph is comprised of many spaces, each tracking their own set of data. Anybody can deploy a Space contract and start their own knowledge graph or reference data in other spaces. Additionally, spaces control their own governance and permissions behavior.

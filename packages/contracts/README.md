# Geo Smart Contracts

Solidity smart contracts used by Geo.

## Commands

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
# runs the test suite and generates a gas report for the contract functions
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
# runs the test suite and generates a coverage report for the contracts.
# to view, open the generated ./contracts/coverage/index.html page in a web browser
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

## Polygonscan verification

TODO: Docs for verifying in mainnet

npx hardhat verify <address>

```shell
hardhat run --network polygon_mumbai scripts/deploy.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network polygon_mumbai DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "https://geogenesis.vercel.app/api/page/"
```

## Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).

## Deploying

There are scripts for deploying to various environments in `package.json`. e.g., `deploy:polygon:mumbai`, `deploy:polygon:mainnet`.

The script deploys the Space Registry, as well as two initial Spaces, San Francisco and Health. We then add the San Francisco and Health spaces to the Space Registry using the Space Registry's public functions for adding triple entries -- new spaces are just entries in the registry's triple DB. The addresses and block number for the Space Registry is added to the chain's addresses file (e.g., `137.json for Polygon mainnet). These entries are read by the subgraph deployment when configuring the `networks.json` file in the subgraph directory.

**Note** that the Polygon Mumbai deployment does not have a block number associated with the deployment transaction. You'll have to go to [Mumbai's Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com), plug in the Space Registry contract address, take the block number from the first contract transaction, and plug it into the generated `80001.json` addresses file for `mumbai.` We can then use this file in our subgraph deployments.

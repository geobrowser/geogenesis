# Hypergraph ontology
An ontology is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

This repository outlines the ontology for the Hypergraph's public data model. The Hyphergraph is highly self-referential and data-driven. We define a subset of entities, types, and attributes which are consumed by the Hypergraph to give meaning to the system's functions. 

This is the Hypergraph's ontology. For example, the "Type" entity has a specific identifier, and this identifier when combined with the "Types" attribute and its identifier, defines semantically that an entity is of a certain type. There are other system entities, such as "Name," "Avatar," etc. which are used to define commonly used data models across the Hypergraph.

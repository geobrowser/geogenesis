/**
 * We currently index two sets of contracts representing spaces:
 * 1. The original Space contract with simple permissions rules and no proposals.
 * 2. The new (as of January 23rd, 2024) DAO-based contracts with Plugins representing
 *    the Space and any governance and permissions rules.
 *
 * Having multiple sets of contracts means that we support multiple methods for
 * indexing data from these contracts, including the data representing the contracts
 * themselves like the address of the contract and any plugins (if they exist).
 *
 * This file is used to map the space metadata for the _new_ contracts. Currently
 * we index the old contracts in `map-entries.ts` by simply taking the space address
 * of any content added to the old contracts and putting it into the 'spaces' table.
 *
 * We will eventually deprecate the existing contracts and migrate data and permissions
 * in them to the new contract implementation. To do this we will likely only index the
 * old contracts up to a specific block number and then index the new contracts from that
 * block.
 *
 * Alternatively we might look to "snapshot" the state of Geo at a specific timepoint
 * and migrate fully to the new contracts. This would likely coincide with a migration
 * to a separate blockchain.

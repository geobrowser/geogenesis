 * Aggregate all relations for any new versions in this block. Relations point
 * to versions for the type, from, and to entities. This means we need to collect
 * the latest versions for each entity referenced by a relation.
 *
 * The latest version references for a relation may also be created in the edit
 * where the relation was created.
 *
 * There's a lot of work needed to collect all of the relations to write for a
 * given new version.
 * 1. Collect all of the entity ids referenced by all new relations in this block
 * 2. Get the last valid version for each entity id referenced in this block, e.g.,
 *    ids for entities referenced in relations or in new versions
 * 3. For each edit (to ensure we are referencing new versions from the correct edit)
 *    a. Select the last version either from the db or from the edit for each entity id
 *    b. Get all of the db relations for each last valid version in this edit
 *    c. Get which of the db relations are being deleted in this edit
 *    d. Filter out any of the db relations that are being deleted
 *    e. Map the still-valid db relations to any new versions in this edit
 *    f. Map new relations in this edit using the new triples and the latest versions
 *       for each entity id
 * 4. Return all of the relations to write
 *
 * @NOTE: This level of complexity is mostly only necessary because we are pointing
 * relations to specific versions instead of just the entity id. The benefit of this
 * is that we can read a relation at any point in time and know that it's pointing to
 * the correct version at the same point in time. Otherwise we would need to traverse
 * the versions for each entity in a relation and find the correct version for the
 * relation at the time the relation was created.
 *
 * @params versions - The versions that have been created in this block as array of {@link Schema.versions.Insertable}
 * @params edits - The edits that have been created in this block as array of {@link Schema.edits.Insertable}
 * @params triples - The triples that have been created in this block as array of {@link OpWithCreatedBy}
 * @returns relations â€“ The relations to write as array of {@link Schema.relations.Insertable}

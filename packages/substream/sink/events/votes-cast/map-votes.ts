 * Proposals represent a proposal to change the state of a DAO-based space. Proposals can

 * Currently we use a simple majority voting model, where a proposal requires 51% of the
 * available votes in order to pass. Only editors are allowed to vote on proposals, but editors
 * _and_ members can create them.

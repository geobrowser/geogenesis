     * There is an edge case where there may be multiple versions created for an entity
     * across multiple spaces. Each version might have a different set of changes applied
     * to them in the edits. When both are accepted we need to merge the changes from each
     * version into a single version which has all of the changes across all of the spaces.
     *
     * Alternatively we only scope versions to one space at a time rather than having a
     * unified version across all spaces. This would mean that we never need to merge, but
     * clients would have to be aware of which version to query for.
     *
     * Currently this data service doesn't solve for this edge case, partly because block sizes
     * are very small on Arbitrum One, and partly because we haven't settled on the API spec
     * yet which would inform the right approach.

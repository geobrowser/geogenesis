/**
 * Merges versions from the same entity into a new version. If many versions change
 * the same entity in the same block we need to make sure that there exists a version
 * that contains all of the changes from each of the versions. If we don't, then we
 * end up in a situation where there are many valid versions for the same entity at one
 * time, and none of them contain all of the changes from the other versions.
 *
 * @NOTE that this only occurs in scenarios where many versions for the same entity are
 * approved/executed in the same block.
 *
 * There's a few ways to solve this issue:
 * 1. At query time we materialize all of the "valid" versions for an entity and merge
 *    them before returning to the caller. This is effectively duplicating the work in
 *    the API server that the indexer is already doing for versions.
 * 2. We can make a new version at indexing time to handle the aggregated versions. The
 *    downside of this approach is that we create more duplicated triples as well as
 *    rewrites history. This acts similarly to how "merge" commit works in git.
 * 3. We don't merge at all and rely on the clients to merge all concurrently valid versions.
 *    This won't work as each version wouldn't correctly handle possible deleted triples
 *    across versions unless we stored the triples as ops with their opType, which we
 *    don't currently do.
 *
 * This function implements #2. The implementation might change in the future as we get more
 * feedback on our versioning mechanisms.

 * Events from our DAO-based contracts might be emitted from different contracts. e.g.,

 *
 * This function looks up the space-id for a given plugin address.
 *
 * @TODO: We should only emit events from the substream that map to spaces we track. We
 * can store the association between plugins and spaces in a substream store and emit it
 * along with the event instead of having to read from the DB every time we receive an
 * event that comes from a plugin.

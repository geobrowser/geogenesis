- Users can reference entities that do not already exist in the KG, or are not created as part of the edit. This is useful for a few reasons. 1) You might create edits in different spaces that reference entities in each other. These spaces may have different governance rules, and might get added to the KG out of order. This should be supported. 2) With sharding an indexer may not have all the entity data in their local database, but the entity might still exist in the global KG.

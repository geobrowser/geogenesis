/**
 * We currently index two sets of contracts representing spaces:
 * 1. The original Space contract with simple permissions rules and no proposals.
 * 2. The new (as of January 23rd, 2024) DAO-based contracts with Plugins representing
 *    the Space and any governance and permissions rules.
 *
 * Having multiple sets of contracts means that we support multiple methods for
 * indexing data from these contracts, including the data representing the contracts
 * themselves like the address of the contract and any plugins (if they exist).
 *
 * We will eventually deprecate the existing contracts and migrate data and permissions
 * in them to the new contract implementation. To do this we will likely only index the
 * old contracts up to a specific block number and then index the new contracts from that
 * block.
 *
 * Alternatively we might look to "snapshot" the state of Geo at a specific timepoint
 * and migrate fully to the new contracts. This would likely coincide with a migration
 * to a separate blockchain.
 *
 * The new, DAO-based contracts are based on Aragon's OSX architecture in which a DAO's
 * onchain functionality is defined by a set of plugin contracts. These plugins can be
 * used for things like governance, membership, or representing an append-only log of
 * IPFS content.
